  <h3>
    About Me
  </h3>
  <p>
    Hello, my name is Tony Domante, and I am on a journey to become a software developer.<br>
    My path has not been easy, as I have faced significant challenges throughout my life. Unlike many,<br>
    I do not have the luxury of pursuing higher education in a traditional manner.<br>
    However, I am determined to overcome these obstacles by becoming a self-taught programmer.<br>
    My aim is to secure a stable job that will allow me to support myself while pursuing my ultimate<br>
    goal of studying electrical engineering.
  </p>
  <p>
    Becoming a software developer is only the first step in my larger vision. My passion lies in the<br>
    creation and development of technology that can improve the world and make it a safer place. I firmly<br>
    believe that to achieve this, it is essential to pair innovative hardware with equally well-designed<br>
    software. By mastering software development, I will be equipped to design and integrate the best<br>
    possible software solutions for the hardware products I aim to create in the future.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Although I am starting from scratch, I have found the learning process to be both challenging and<br>
    fulfilling. I already have several ideas in mind for projects that will help me build my developer<br>
    portfolio, and I am committed to refining my skills. This is just the beginning of my journey to<br>
    becoming a skilled engineer, and I look forward to using my talents to contribute to the betterment of<br>
    <strong>all mankind!</strong>
  </p>

  <h3>Skills</h3>
  <p>Proficient in Apple hardware, macOS, iOS, and Windows, with familiarity in Linux. I have
    advanced expertise in Adobe Creative Suite, particularly Photoshop, Illustrator, and
    Acrobat Pro. My experience spans graphic design, with a portfolio of website and logo
    designs, and creating marketing materials that boost brand visibility. I have extensive
    customer service experience, including in restaurant settings, where I&apos;ve honed my skills
    in building rapport, ensuring satisfaction, and working efficiently under pressure.
    Additionally, I have strong analytical skills for resolving technical issues and excellent
    communication abilities.</p>
